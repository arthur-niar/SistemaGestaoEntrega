City's breaking down on a camel's back
They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
You won't get undercounted 'cause you're damned and free
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style
A melancholy town where we never smile
And all I wanna hear is the message beep
My dreams, they got her kissing 'cause I don't get sleep, no
Windmill, windmill for the land
Turn forever, hand in hand
Take it all in on your stride
It is ticking, falling down
Love forever, love is free
Let's turn forever, you and me
Windmill, windmill for the land
Is everybody in?
Laughin' gas, these hazmats, fast cats, linin' 'em up like ass cracks
Play these ponies at the track, it's my chocolate attack
Shit, I'm steppin' in the heart of this here (yeah)
Care Bear reppin' in harder this year (yeah), watch me as I gravitate
Yo, we gon' ghost town this Motown, with yo' sound, you in the blink
Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us, with yo' sound, you kill the Inc.
So don't stop, get it, get it (yeah) until you're cheddar-headed
And watch the way I navigate, haha-haha

Don't stop, get it, get it (sha, sha-ba-da)
Peep how your captain's in it (sha-ba-da-ca, feel good)
Steady, watch me navigate (sha, sha-ba-da, feel good)
